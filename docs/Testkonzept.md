# Testing Guide

This document describes how we test the Techmodule Eâ€‘Commerce Plattform scaffold across backend and frontend. It focuses on local developer workflow on Windows and aligns with our repository conventions.

- Backend: Spring Boot 3 (Java 21), JUnit 5, Spring Test, Mockito
- Frontend: Angular 20, Karma/Jasmine unit tests; basic Playwright e2e planned
- Orchestration: Docker Compose for local dev (not required for unit tests)

## Test Strategy

We aim for a pragmatic testing pyramid:
- Unit/Web-layer tests first: fast, isolated, deterministic
- Service/Repository tests second: targeted persistence tests with H2 or Testcontainers (planned)
- End-to-End (e2e) UI tests: a small, valuable path coverage using Playwright (basic suite scaffolded)

Current coverage (baseline):
- Backend web-layer tests for Health, Product, Cart, and Checkout controllers using @WebMvcTest and mocked dependencies.
- Frontend unit tests for CartService, HomeComponent, CheckoutComponent, Login, Register.
- Basic Playwright e2e scaffold present; full end-to-end coverage is planned.

Stripe and any external integrations are mocked in tests.

## How to run tests (Windows)

Backend (Maven):
- From repository root or module directory:
  - cd e-commerce-backend
  - mvn -q test
- Run a specific test class (example):
  - mvn -q -Dtest=org.ch.ecommerce.school.ecommercebackend.controller.HealthControllerTest test
- Tips:
  - First run may download dependencies. To prefetch: mvn -U dependency:go-offline
  - If behind a proxy, configure %USERPROFILE%\.m2\settings.xml

Frontend (Angular):
- From repository root or module directory:
  - cd e-commerce-frontend
  - npm ci
  - npm test

Frontend e2e (Playwright):
- Prerequisites: Node.js installed; browsers installed for Playwright (npx playwright install)
- Run:
  - cd e-commerce-frontend
  - npx playwright test

Note: For unit tests, Docker services are not required. e2e may require the dev servers running via docker compose up --build or ng serve + backend.

## Scope and conventions

Backend:
- Use @WebMvcTest for controller tests; mock collaborating services/repositories.
- Prefer descriptive test names. Given/When/Then structure in code or comments.
- Validate both happy paths and error paths (validation errors, 404, etc.).
- Avoid real network/DB calls in unit/web-layer tests.
- For persistence tests (planned): prefer Testcontainers PostgreSQL or H2 with Flyway, and clear migrations per test suite.

Frontend:
- Unit test components and services with Jasmine/Karma.
- Mock HttpClient with HttpTestingController or mock ApiService.
- Avoid actual Stripe initialization in unit tests; assert UI state instead.
- Keep tests deterministic; avoid relying on timers or external state.

Test data and fixtures:
- Use builders/factories for DTOs/entities to keep tests readable.
- Prefer inline test data for small cases; use helper functions for repeated structures.

## CI considerations (planned)

- Pipeline runs Maven tests for backend and npm test for frontend on every PR.
- Optional e2e job via Playwright on demand or nightly.
- Cache Maven and npm dependencies to speed up builds.

## Troubleshooting

Backend Maven issues:
- Tests not found: ensure JUnit 5 is used and correct FQN specified with -Dtest.
- Dependency resolution failures: ensure internet access or run mvn -U dependency:go-offline. If needed, clear cache for the module in %USERPROFILE%\.m2\repository.

Frontend issues:
- Karma cannot start Chrome: install Chrome or use Chromium via Playwright; ensure npx playwright install ran if your config depends on it.
- TypeScript path or module errors: run npm ci to get exact lockfile deps.

General:
- Ports in use when running e2e: ensure 4200/8080/5432 are free or stop other services. Use docker compose down to free ports.
